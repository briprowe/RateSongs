Rate the song currently playing in Banshee.

To use, run python rate.py. At this point Ctrl-F1 will rate the
current song with 1 star, Ctrl-F2 will award 2 stars... up to Ctrl-F5
for 5 stars.

I suggest putting 'python <path to>/rate.py' in your set of 'Startup
Applications.'

NOTE: This has only been tested with Ubuntu 11.04.

TODO
----

1) Add robustness!
2) Add Rhythmbox support.
